## Hi there 👋  
### I'm Taciana Gomes — Curious by nature, researcher at heart.

I dive deep into **mathematics, machine learning, data science, and evolutionary computation** — not because I *have to*, but because I *love to understand, explore and create*. I’m driven by curiosity and a deep desire to build knowledge that matters.

### 🧠 What I’m passionate about  
🔹 **Machine Learning & Meta-Learning** – exploring how models can *learn to learn*  
🔹 **Data Science & Analytics** – turning raw data into insights  
🔹 **Evolutionary Computation** – optimization and adaptation inspired by nature  
🔹 **Mathematics** – the foundation of understanding patterns and structures  
🔹 **Science & Research** – asking questions that lead to deeper answers

🚀 Some Projects I’m Proud Of

✨ **Geometric Patterns in Prime Spirals**  
![Prime Spirals](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Geometric%20Primes-blue?style=flat)  
Investigates how prime numbers form striking geometric structures when embedded in *polar spirals*, combining visualization, statistical exploration and pattern analysis to reveal hidden regularities in prime distributions.

📊 **Geometric Analysis of Prime Density (Halos)**  
![Halos](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Halos-green?style=flat)  
A study on local prime densities using *logarithmic spiral embeddings* and adaptive neighborhood features. This project explores how primes cluster at different scales with geometric and spatial methods.

🔍 **Geometric Null Models for Prime Distributions**  
![Null Models](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Null%20Models-purple?style=flat)  
Develops geometric embeddings of prime numbers calibrated with Cramér-type null models to analyze multi-scale density patterns, comparing observed distributions against theoretical expectations for deeper understanding.

### 🌱 Always learning…

## 💖 Beyond Code

When I’m not exploring data or crafting algorithms, I love to:

- ✍️ Write stories and creative pieces  
- 🎨 Paint and express myself through art  
- 🌿 Wander in nature and find inspiration outdoors

These passions fuel my curiosity and creativity both in life and in research.
